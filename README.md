Speed Calculator v1.00

The Speed Calculator is a tool designed to help analyse data from a Picoscope oscilloscope. It calculates the speed of an object based on the distance travelled, and the time intervals captured by the oscilloscope. This tool processes the data and outputs the speed in multiple units such as miles per hour (mph), meters per second (m/s), feet per second (fps), and yards per second (yd/s).

In addition to calculating the speed, this tool can also calculate the kinetic energy of an object by its mass. The speed of the mass will be calculated based on the distance and time entered earlier
